SORT ATTRIBUTE?
--------
• the "sort: code looks at strings from left to right.

const drinks = [ "wine", "smoothie", "bubble tea", "juice"];
drinks.sort();

console.log(drinks);
//-> ["bubble tea", "juice", "smoothie", "wine"]

• With numbers, it's the same. The number first smallest number gets in order first
  and not the overall biggest number.

const numbers = [ "10000", "34, "310", "2", "9"];
numbers.sort();

console.log(numbers);
//-> ["10000", "2", "310", "34", "9"];
